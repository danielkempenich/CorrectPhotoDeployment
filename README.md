A script to correct the file layout of photos to match the timestamp directory

This is a simple script intended to correct the file layout of photos.  They were initally imported by Picassa into the wrong timestamp directory.  Instead of finding them all by hand, I wrote this script to compare the photo metadata with the timestamp directory it resides in.

E.g.  C:\\photos\\2012-05-14\\IMG_20191018_123456 should be moved to C:\\photos\\2019-10-18\\IMG_20191018_123456
